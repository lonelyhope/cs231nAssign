"""Container module for transports

Transports are expected to be the modular backends of aiocoap, and implement
the specifics of eg. TCP, WebSockets or SMS, possibly divided by backend
implementations as well. (If, for example, a non-posix platform is added, it
might be easier to rewrite the :mod:`.udp6` for that platform
instead of "ifdef hell").
